# Sports-Image-Classification-CNN
A Sports Image Classification model using CNN is a machine learning model that is trained to classify images of sports into different categories. The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a type of deep learning algorithm that is particularly well-suited for image classification tasks.
The process of building the model typically starts with collecting a large dataset of images of sports, along with their labels (e.g. basketball, soccer, tennis, etc.). These images are then pre-processed and augmented to increase the diversity of the dataset.
Next, the CNN architecture is designed and implemented using a deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The architecture typically includes multiple layers of convolutional and pooling layers, followed by one or more fully connected layers.
The model is then trained on the dataset using backpropagation algorithm, and the weights of the network are updated in order to minimize the error on the training set. The model is then tested on a separate test dataset to evaluate its performance and fine-tune it if needed.
Once the model is trained, it can be used to classify new images of sports into the different categories it was trained on, with a high degree of accuracy .
